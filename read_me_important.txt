I uploaded the .cs file alone to demonstrate all the components needed for the badge. I originally did the program in Visual Studios,
however, and various VS features may or may not have been implemented and could result in an issue when running the code using a different method/without other background files. In my current project set-up, everything works perfect. 

Thanks!
